# dotfiles of Kevin Qian

## Why
I started to manage and host my dotfiles inspired by some of my friend (special thanks to Colin [@colinxy](https://github.com/colinxy)). Also there are some good suggestions in http://dotfiles.github.io  

Unfortunately, I have to __GIVE UP__ my original `dot` utils. Creating a `.git` at `$HOME` directory degrades my terminal's performance seriously (as my terminal has git highlighting from Powerline)   

I have also migrated my `emacs` to `spacemacs`, preferring an artificial `evil` layer on top.  

I have just started to care about these dotfiles, so the configurations are mostly lacking.  

## Included files
All tracked files are specified in `.dotrc`, which is added with `dot -s [filenames]`. A copy is mentioned here:  
```
.bash_profile # I am not using .bashrc
.emacs.d # emacs config
.vim # vim plugins and custom source scripts
.vimrc # vim config
```
